# arduino-keypad-advanced

I wanted more than just a basic example of the keypad matrix working.

I wanted more feedback from the device.

1. Feedback that the device is working. The LED colors rotate when idle.
1. Feedback when a button was pressed. I wanted to control the LED (color and brightness) when a button is pressed.
