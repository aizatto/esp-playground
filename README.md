# esp32 zigbee device

Follow me as I figure out how to get zigbee working on an esp32-c6.

Disclaimers:
1. This is really bad code. There is a lot of commented code.
2. Do not use this for production.
3. I'm not a C coder, and I'm buliding this based on the limited [documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-zigbee-sdk/en/latest/esp32/index.html) and [examples](https://github.com/espressif/esp-zigbee-sdk/tree/main/examples) available.
4. I hope this can be useful to others out there.
