# esp playground 

Follow me as I learn how to code for the ESP32.

Disclaimers:
1. This is really bad code. It is frakenstein's spaghetti.
   1. There is a lot of commented code.
   2. Magic numbers should be constants
   3. Variables could be better named
2. Do not use this for production.
3. I'm not a C coder.
4. I hope this can be useful to others out there.
